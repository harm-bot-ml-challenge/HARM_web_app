# HARM - ML Challenge

HARM, a ThinkBeyondExams intern team, aims to expand the world of AI with a little step of providing users a feature which shows the category of a YouTube video currently played.

Using the Python programming language and various Machine Learning concepts to create a Text classification and Image classification model which classifies a YouTube Video as Educational and cat- egorises it under category and sub-category as per the categories list of Beyond Exams Website.


## Problem Statement
A) Given a Youtube video:
1. Determine if it is an educational video or not.
2. Determine which category or subcategory of Beyon- dExam would it belong to.  

B) Accuracy: 90percent on custom dataset that will be provided after proof of concept.  
C) Should be able to run in near-real-time on a server.  

## Tools Using
```
scikit-learn
bokeh
chime
matplotlib
nltk
numpy
pandas
Pillow
pytube
requests
scikit_image
stqdm
streamlit
streamlit_player
toml
youtube_search_python
scrapetube
youtube-dl
```

## Implementation till now  
- Built a real worl Web Application, which takes an input of a YouTube Video URL and runs our algorithms of fetching and retrieving the information on it.
- Made a dataset generation file, which generates the dataset as per our requirements and is generating the data right now.
- Making the model file, to run it when the dataset is generated.
- Till now not faced any big problems, everything is going as planned. Hope of that in future too.
